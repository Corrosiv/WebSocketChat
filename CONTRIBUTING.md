# Contributing

Thanks for taking an interest. This project follows a simple workflow intended for a single developer with reviewer-friendly PRs.

Getting started
- Clone the repo and open the solution in Visual Studio or use the `dotnet` CLI.
- Build: `dotnet build LiveChatServer`
- Run locally: `dotnet run --project LiveChatServer`
- Run tests: `dotnet test` (tests are in `tests/` when present)

Branching & workflow
- Work on the `dev` branch. Create short-lived feature branches off `dev`:
  - `feat/<short-desc>` for new features
  - `fix/<short-desc>` for bug fixes
  - `chore/<short-desc>` for infra/docs
- When a sprint or feature is complete, open a PR from your branch into `dev` for review.
- When `dev` reaches a stable sprint state, open a PR from `dev` → `main`.

Commit messages
- Follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format: `type(scope): description`.
- Use **lowercase**, **imperative mood**, and keep the subject line under ~72 characters.
- Common types:
  - `feat` — new feature or user-facing behavior
  - `fix` — bug fix
  - `test` — adding or updating tests
  - `refactor` — code restructuring without behavior change
  - `chore` — tooling, docs, CI, dependency updates
- Scope is optional but encouraged (e.g., `feat(client):`, `test(typing):`).
- Examples:
  - `feat(client): load recent message history on connect`
  - `test: add per-test SQLite isolation and include test project in solution`
  - `chore: complete Sprint 1 MVP (#1)`

Pull requests
- Use the provided PR template (`.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`).
- PR title should follow the same Conventional Commits format as commit messages.
- Ensure CI passes and at least one reviewer approves before merging into `main`.
- Keep PRs focused and include a short description and verification steps.

Code style & quality
- Follow rules in `LiveChatServer.GeneratedMSBuildEditorConfig.editorconfig`.
- Keep changes small and well-documented. Add or update docs under `Solution Items/` when behavior or APIs change.

Issues & security
- Open issues for bugs and enhancements; tag with appropriate labels.
- For security issues, follow the guidance in `SECURITY.md` (if present) or contact the repo owner privately.

Thank you — contributions and reviews are welcome. If unsure, open an issue or a draft PR to start the discussion.
